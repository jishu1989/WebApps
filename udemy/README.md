# Python Notes

## Data structures

- What is data structure? Structure that can hold data together.
- Data structure used to store collection of related data
- Built-in data structure in python:
    - **list:** list is a collection of data. It can be a text, number, string = mixed type. Items in a list are ordered by their index and are changeable.
lists are created with square brackets[], and elements within a list are separated by comma. To check more list methods f.e extend(), appends(), etc for list manipulation check the exercise : ```mylist.py```.
    - **tuple:** 
    - **set:**
    - **dictionary:**
 

## Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented programming breaks things into object and interacts with each other. Objects are created from class. It uses DRY(Don't repeat yourself)
concept.  

What is an object? = an object is an entity that does anything. e.g house,car, bank accounts are objects.  

What is a class? = class is a template/blueprint for creating objects. 
- Classes have attributes/properties --> variables that store data.
- Classes have behaviors --> methods ---> functions.
- It is possible to create as many single object from single class.

Creating an object from a class is called instantiating an object.

Accessing attribute of a class : ObjectName.Attribute
