## Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented programming breaks things into object and interacts with each other. Objects are created from class. It uses DRY(Don't repeat yourself)
concept.  

What is an object? = an object is an entity that does anything. e.g house,car, bank accounts are objects.  

What is a class? = class is a template/blueprint for creating objects.
